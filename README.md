## Inspiration
MATH 470, the Cryptography class, is hard. The calculations are ridiculously long and tedious to do by hand, and all the calculators online start breaking due to the large numbers or gave wrong answers or were ugly or simply in French. Because of this, we decided to make a better calculator for doing calculations such as these. 

## What it does
CryptoCalc is a simple website that does modular exponentiation, which calculates a ^ b mod c (a^b % c), and has the ability for users to input extremely large numbers for these calculations.

## How we built it
We built the frontend and UI using Vue.js, and integrated it with python and the backend to be able to perform large calculations. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges like how to combine the frontend and backend and had to learn how to run the website locally using windows terminal. It was also troublesome to download packages and make sure what we downloaded was working, in which we had to make decisions to fix these complications such as running separate virtual environments. A lot of styling for the UI was also difficult to figure out and do.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a floating window for the website and proud that we learned basic web development through the usage of Vue.

## What we learned
We learned the basics of Flask and how to use Vue.js to create webpages in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This helped us create a webpage that allowed user inputs for calculations and a floating window for user accessibility when doing these types of problems.

## What's next for CryptoCalc
We plan to implement more different types of cryptography problems onto our website and make potential changes to the UI to look better.
